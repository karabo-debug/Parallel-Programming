# Monte Carlo Optimization for 2D Function Minimization (Java)

# Overview
This Java project implements a Monte Carlo algorithm to find the minimum (lowest point) of a two-dimensional mathematical function, f(x, y), within a specified range. The algorithm employs random sampling to approximate the minimum value of the function.

# Requirements
Java Development Kit (JDK) (version X.X.X)

# Getting Started
1. Download the project files.

2. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.

3. Use the following command to compile and run the Java program:
   'make run'

4. If need be customize the Makefile by changing the arguments under 'Target to run the MonteCarloMinimization class'

5. Re-run the Makefile command to execute the Monte Carlo optimization algorithm.

6. If it happens you modify any of the programs execute 'make clean', then 'make' and then 'make run'

# Results
The algorithm will output the point (x_min, y_min) that corresponds to the lowest function value found during the iterations. This point serves as an approximation to the minimum of the two-dimensional function.
